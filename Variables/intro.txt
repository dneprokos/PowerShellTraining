You can create a variable and assign it a value in the same step. PowerShell only creates the variable if it doesn't exist. 
Otherwise, it assigns the specified value to the existing variable. The following example stores the current location in the variable $loc:

$loc = Get-Location


PowerShell can use the same environment variables available to any Windows process, including cmd.exe. 
These variables are exposed through a drive named env:. You can view these variables by typing the following command:

Get-ChildItem env:

or 

Get-ChildItem Env:\JAVA_HOME


You can also create and modify environment variables from within PowerShell. 
Environment variables in PowerShell follow the same rules for environment variables used elsewhere in the operating system. 
The following example creates a new environment variable:

$env:LIB_PATH='/usr/local/lib'
