Powershell scripts are store in .ps1 file. By default, you can't run a script by just double-clicking a file. This protects your system from accidental harm.

Moreover, there is a policy which restricts script execution. You can see this policy by running the Get-ExecutionPolicy command.

You will get one of the following output:

Restricted— No scripts are allowed. This is the default setting, so it will display first time when you run the command.
AllSigned— You can run scripts signed by a trusted developer. With the help of this setting, a script will ask for confirmation that you want to run it before executing.
RemoteSigned— You can run your or scripts signed by a trusted developer.
Unrestricted— You can run any script which you wants to run
